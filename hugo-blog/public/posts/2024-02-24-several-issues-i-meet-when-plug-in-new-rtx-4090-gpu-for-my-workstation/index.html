However, I couldn’t find the device information in the UEFI (gigabytes F22B). And this version is\nquiet different from other gigabytes UEFI/BIOS. I search for a long time and didn’t found any information useful.\nNew UI:\nOld UI:\nThere are not so much configuration need to be finished. And I couldn’t find anything related to change from onboard GPU to dedicated GPU HDMI, and many things are setup with “auto”. Thus, I assume the hardware nowadays are intelligent enough to support all kinds of mode without manually setup.\nFirst issue - there is no HDMI output after I enabled CSM(Compatibility Support Module) I searched for some topics about install a new GPU device, which should not work nowadays. It said I need to enable CSM firstly and then enable the dedicated GPU from PCIE. And I also use\ncuda_12.3.2_545.23.08_linux.run to install the cuda and nvidia driver, of course, it doesn’t work at all for current stage.\nHowever, after I enabled the CSM, it require a reboot and I found I couldn’t get any output from HDMI. Then I try to plug the HDMI cable into my 4090 HDMI port. Still nothing output.\nI had tried to reboot for many times and I couldn’t get the output. I was afraid I hot-plug-in-out the HDMI and cause some trouble. Suprisingly, somebody in stackoverflow said it is because the change could let the boot process can’t find the location of bootloader, I can fix it by:\nhold the CMOS button reset the bootloader. I tried and it still doesn’t work. I was very disappointed, and try to remove the 4090 and try again. It didn’t work as well. I did it twice, and that time when the boot start I was playing with dog, after 10 mins, I found it booted and go into the OS terminal.\nThen I realized in the stackoverflow, the people who answer the question also mentioned it may take 5-30mins to let the bootloader to learn. That’s amazing, sometimes waiting is a good option.\nAfter that I could use the nvidia GPU. run nvidia-smi in terminal:\n+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\r| NVIDIA-SMI 545.23.08 Driver Version: 545.23.08 CUDA Version: 12.3 |\r|-----------------------------------------+----------------------+----------------------+\r| GPU Name Persistence-M | Bus-Id Disp.A | Volatile Uncorr.

The booting process becomes very long and I couldn’t ssh to the workstation. After pulling the log:\n[TIME] Timed out waiting for device xxxxxxxxxxxx/wlpxxs0.\r[DEPEND] Dependency failed for WPA supplicant for netplan wlpxxs0. I do some search and found it was because the netplan was down for the device wlp14s0.\nThen I go for the solution:\nhttps://askubuntu.com/questions/1291424/failed-to-start-netplan-wpa-wlan0-sevice-unit-netplan-wpa-wlan0-service-not-fou\nTry to config and reboot. It always failed.\nsudo netplan [--debug] apply ([–debug] means optional)\nI will always get:\nWARNING:root:Cannot call Open vSwitch: ovsdv-server.service is not running so the question is how to restart the ovsdv-server.service.\nI tried:\nsystemctl status ovsdb-server.service systemctl restart ovsdb-server.service Nothing exist, then I realized that I need to uninstall and re-install the module\nsudo apt-get install openvswitch-switch-dpdk But how to get the network, my workstation can only use wifi because the router is too far away.\nAnd I change the configuration in the ‘/etc/wpa_supplicant.conf’\nThen I use wpa sufficant to configure my wifi to login and install all necessaries.\nBut when I use the:\nsudo dmesg | grep wlan I found the wlp15s0 is reset as the wlan0 rather than wlp14s0 in the booting log.\nThen I know I should change the configuration in ‘/etc/netplan/xxx.yaml’\nwifis:\rwlp15s0: Then everything works.\nConclusions This is a very tedious debug work, but it also teach me how to narrow down the problem step by step, find the root cause for the chained problems.\nAnd it also tell me how to do some search use the log, dmesg, and the devices naming, configuration. For me it’s a good experience.\n",

<p>After the bootloader was recovered I meet another issue. The booting process becomes very long and I couldn&rsquo;t ssh to the workstation. After pulling the log:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>[TIME] Timed out waiting for device xxxxxxxxxxxx/wlpxxs0.
[DEPEND] Dependency failed for WPA supplicant for netplan wlpxxs0.
</code></pre><p>I do some search and found it was because the netplan was down for the device wlp14s0.</p>
<p>Then I go for the solution:</p>
<p><a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/1291424/failed-to-start-netplan-wpa-wlan0-sevice-unit-netplan-wpa-wlan0-service-not-fou">https://askubuntu.com/questions/1291424/failed-to-start-netplan-wpa-wlan0-sevice-unit-netplan-wpa-wlan0-service-not-fou</a></p>
<p>Try to config and reboot. It always failed.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>sudo netplan [--debug] apply
</code></pre><p>([&ndash;debug] means optional)</p>
<p>I will always get:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>WARNING:root:Cannot call Open vSwitch: ovsdv-server.service is not running
</code></pre><hr>
<p>so the question is how to restart the ovsdv-server.service.</p>
<p>I tried:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>systemctl status ovsdb-server.service 
systemctl restart ovsdb-server.service
</code></pre><p>Nothing exist, then I realized that I need to uninstall and re-install the module</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>sudo apt-get install openvswitch-switch-dpdk
</code></pre><p>But how to get the network, my workstation can only use wifi because the router is too far away.</p>
<hr>
<p>And I change the configuration in the &lsquo;/etc/wpa_supplicant.conf&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then I use wpa sufficant to configure my wifi to login and install all necessaries.</p>
<p>But when I use the:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>sudo dmesg | grep wlan
</code></pre><p>I found the wlp15s0 is reset as the wlan0 rather than wlp14s0 in the booting log.</p>
<p>Then I know I should change the configuration in &lsquo;/etc/netplan/xxx.yaml&rsquo;</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>  wifis:
    wlp15s0:
</code></pre><p>Then everything works.</p>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conclusions">#</a></h2>
<p>This is a very tedious debug work, but it also teach me how to narrow down the problem step by step, find the root cause for the chained problems.</p>
<p>And it also tell me how to do some search use the log, dmesg, and the devices naming, configuration. For me it&rsquo;s a good experience.</p>
