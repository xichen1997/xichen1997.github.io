Problem statement
You have a fair coin, which means a flip result could be tail(T) and head(H), and their probability is 50%.
You cast the coin until the coin until have a pattern &ldquo;THTHT&rdquo; or &ldquo;THHHT&rdquo;, which one is easier to get? And their probability?
First thought
Lots of people will think they are identical intuitivly because &ldquo;T&rdquo; and &ldquo;H&rdquo; both have same probability to get. Then their probability is $\frac{1}{2}^5$.">

Then their probability is $\\frac{1}{2}^5$.\nBut then this idea will disappear because of the method above is to extra 5-times result from an infinite sequence, but the statement is to construct a sequence to see which pattern we can get.\nMarkov chain We can use different state to represent the status for each step:\nEach toss has an equal probability (0.5) of being Heads (H) or Tails (T). Based on this, we define the transitions between states: From State 0: On H: Move to State H (probability 0.5). On T: Remain in State 0 (probability 0.5). From State H: On H: Remain in State H (probability 0.5). On T: Move to State HT (probability 0.5). From State HT: On H: Move to State HTH (probability 0.5). On T: Move to State HTT (probability 0.5).

From State HTTT: On H: Move to State B (sequence HTTTH achieved) (probability 0.5). On T: Move to State 0 (probability 0.5). States A and B are absorbing; once entered, the process stops. The markov chain graph looks like: Intuitivly, we can see the path to HTHTH, at state “HTHT”, it could transfer to “HTT”, which belongs to B state. Then we could say it’s more likely to get B rather than A.\nFinal calculation We assume the probability reaching A is u. Then:\nBased on the transitions, we create equations for u_i:\nFrom State 0: $u_0 = 0.5 \\times u_H + 0.5 \\times u_0$ Simplifies to: $u_0 = u_H$ From State H: $u_H = 0.5 \\times u_H + 0.5 \\times u_{HT}$ Simplifies to: $u_H = u_{HT}$ From State HT: $u_{HT} = 0.5 \\times u_{HT} + 0.5 \\times u_{HTT}$ From State HTH: $u_{HTH} = 0.5 \\times u_H + 0.5 \\times u_{HTT}$ From State HTHT: $u_{HTHT} = 0.5 \\times 1 + 0.5 \\times u_{HTTT}$ (Since reaching State A has a probability of 1) From State HTT: $u_{HTT} = 0.5 \\times u_H + 0.5 \\times u_{HTTT}$ From State HTTT: $u_{HTTT} = 0.5 \\times 0 + 0.5 \\times u_0$ (Since reaching State B has a probability of 0 for reaching A) Then the probability before reaching before B is $\\frac{4}{9}$ And the probability to get A is $1-\\frac{4}{9} = \\frac{5}{9}$\nThen A is more easy to get.\n",

<p>Lots of people will think they are identical intuitivly because &ldquo;T&rdquo; and &ldquo;H&rdquo; both have same probability to get. Then their probability is $\frac{1}{2}^5$.</p>

<p>We assume the probability reaching A is u. Then:</p>
<p>Based on the transitions, we create equations for u_i:</p>
<ol>
<li>From State 0: $u_0 = 0.5 \times u_H + 0.5 \times u_0$ Simplifies to: $u_0 = u_H$</li>

<li>From State HT: $u_{HT} = 0.5 \times u_{HT} + 0.5 \times u_{HTT}$</li>
<li>From State HTH: $u_{HTH} = 0.5 \times u_H + 0.5 \times u_{HTT}$</li>
<li>From State HTHT: $u_{HTHT} = 0.5 \times 1 + 0.5 \times u_{HTTT}$ (Since reaching State A has a probability of 1)</li>
<li>From State HTT: $u_{HTT} = 0.5 \times u_H + 0.5 \times u_{HTTT}$</li>
<li>From State HTTT: $u_{HTTT} = 0.5 \times 0 + 0.5 \times u_0$ (Since reaching State B has a probability of 0 for reaching A)</li>

<p>Then the probability before reaching before B is $\frac{4}{9}$ And the probability to get A is $1-\frac{4}{9} = \frac{5}{9}$</p>
