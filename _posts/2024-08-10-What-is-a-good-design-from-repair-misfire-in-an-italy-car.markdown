# BackGround 
I own a Alfa Romeo Giulia Quadrifoglio, which is a car has lots of disputation because of its good driving feeling and unrealiablility.

From my experience, it's a performance monster car but can be very quiet and gentle if you just wanna daily. However, the realiability is indeed a problem for me.

I have lots of scanning code for it.
